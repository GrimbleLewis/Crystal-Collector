# Crystal Collector

A guessing game that uses Math.random and on.click functions in order to reach a certain number without going over.

This activity went over creating a page layout with bootstrap and pushing text to the html through javascript/jquery as well as creating reset and win/loss functions in order to keep track of your score and for the game to restart without reloading the page.
